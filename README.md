## Overview

### What is this?

I love programming and every now and then I pull out some bizarre project like this one. Preety is an **educational tool** to make the SQL learning experience more appealing. It is made up of a lightweight relational database based upon **AlaSQL.js** and its extensions to the language. AlaSQL it's working towards a full database engine complying with most of the SQL-99 language, spiced up with additional syntax for NoSQL (schema-less) data and graph networks. This project was born for fun and I hope it can be an inspiration for those approaching web development. Everything was designed and written from scratch.

### How to start ?

On the Preety platform you have a ready-to-use database called **dbo** which is selected by default and has some tables already populated with entries but feel free to start from scratch if you wish. Remember, AlaSQL stores data on browser memory and changes are lost when you leave the website, so be careful!
